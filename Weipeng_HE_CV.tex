\section{Experience}

\textbf{Idiap Research Institute}  \hfill Switzerland \\
\textit{Research Assistant} \hfill June 2016 - Present
\vspace{-.9\parskip}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigated deep learning-based method for sound source localization in real human robot interaction scenarios. Achieved more than 90\% precision and recall for detecting and localizing multiple simultaneous sources in real-time.
    [\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4EwuVlE_pU}{video demo}]
  \item Investigated method for simultaneous localization and speech/non-speech classification of multiple sound sources. The joint multi-task approach significantly outperforms traditional methods those sequentially process localization and classification.
